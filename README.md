# Java course
The main purpose of this repo is to document my journey of becoming a developer and hopefully to help others achieve the same goal as me. Fell free to look around and use the repo's content to help you study. 

## What you'll find in this repo
Here you'll find: 
- `.md` files with explanations and thoughts about what I'm studying 
- source code for projects 
- links to the resources I'm using 
- links to other projects that have their own repo
